## Primer

**GUIDE IS STILL WIP!** At the moment this guide is just an outline (used as a personal reference). Eventually it will be upgraded to a full-fledged guide.

### What is Agones?

> [Agones](https://agones.de) is an open source platform, for deploying, hosting, scaling, and orchestrating dedicated game servers for large scale multiplayer games, built on top of the industry standard, distributed system platform [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Agones solves a lot of the problems that can occur when trying to scale and/or maintain the server infrastrucure. Especially for smaller game studios it's a good solution since it solves a lot of common problems.

>- Any game server that can run on Linux can be hosted and orchestrated on Agones - in any language, or set of dependencies.
>- Run Agones anywhere Kubernetes can run - in the cloud, on premise, on your local machine or anywhere else you need it.
>- Game services and your game servers can be on the same foundational platform - simplifying your tooling and your operations knowledge.
>- By extending Kubernetes, Agones allows you to take advantage of the thousands of developers that have worked on the features of Kubernetes, and the ecosystem of tools surround it.
>- Agones is free, open source and developed entirely in the public. Help shape its future by getting involved with the community.

### What is Google GameServer?

[Google Game Server](https://cloud.google.com/game-servers) is a managment layer that sits on top of Agones. It isn't strictly needed and you can get by without if you desire. This guide uses GameServers though.

>Game Servers takes the pain out of managing your global game server infrastructure, so you can focus on creating great games faster, without increasing complexity or compromising on performance. Game Servers fully manages Agones, an open source game server management project that runs on Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

First of all, you will need a few things:

- A source build of UE5 (this guide uses UE 5.0.1 from the [release branch from GitHub](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release))
- A Google Cloud Account to access the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Docker for Windows
- Your game build, ready to build a dedicated servers

## Getting your game build ready

### Agones

This section describes the process to get your game build ready for Agones:

1. Parsing Agones Port info
2. Adding Agones health checks
3. Agones call PlayerReady

We can also use:

`RegisterServer` (AGameSession) to call `SetLabel`, `SetPlayerCapacity`

`PostLogin` (AGameMode) to call `PlayerConnect`

`NotifyLogout` (AGameSession) to call `PlayerDisconnect`

There is a UE4 Plugin for Agones that can be used.

### Building and Packaging

Build your dedicated server for Linux. This won't be covered here, since there are a lot of [guides](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Networking/HowTo/DedicatedServers/) out there for that.

### Docker

Next we need to create a Docker Image of the Linux server build. Dockerfile can look like this (replace GAMENAME):

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN useradd -m ue4
USER ue4:ue4
ADD --chown=ue4:ue4 LinuxServer /home/ue4
RUN chmod a+x /home/ue4/GAMENAMEServer.sh /home/ue4/GAMENAME/Binaries/Linux/GAMENAMEServer
ENTRYPOINT [ "/home/ue4/GAMENAMEServer.sh" ]
```

Make sure Google Container Registry is active for your Google Cloud Account. Create a [JSON file for authentication](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json-key). Run:

`docker login -u _json_key --password-stdin https://gcr.io < key.json`

Obtain your Google project ID and build the docker file: 

`docker build -t gcr.io/GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID/gameserver:latest . `

Don't forget the dot at the end. It's important! When doing a rebuild, add `--no-cache` to the arguments list. After a successful build, you can test running the server locally:

`docker run -p 7777:7777/udp gcr.io/GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID/gameserver:latest`

When it runs okay, push the docker image to the registry:

`docker push gcr.io/GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID/gameserver:latest`
